# Human-Activities-Time-Series-Classification
This machine learning project:    
• Built and trained multiple machine learning models to classify 7 types of human activities based on 3 key time-domain features extracted from time series data obtained by a wireless sensor network.  
• Validated the best Lasso-regularized logistic regression model with a classification accuracy of 100% and 2 Naïve Bayes’ classifier using Gaussian and Multinomial priors with an accuracy of 89%.


This project is Homework 3 & 4 for the course DSCI552 Machine Learning for Data Science.

The dataset came from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/366/activity+recognition+system+based+on+multisensor+data+fusion+arem.
